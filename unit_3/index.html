	<h4 class="section header">About us</h4>
	<p>Lorem ipsum is founded by two girls who were fed up with all of the hassles of going out. Just picture 3 feet of snow, a parka, heels, and a long line... all while losing your buzz. Not fun. So we decided to change the game.</p> 

	<p>Our goal is to bring the fun back to all aspects of going out. Use lorem ipsum to learn details about spots in your area while getting a look a what's happening at that very moment. We're putting the power back in your hands, ladies and gents. Quite literally.</p>
